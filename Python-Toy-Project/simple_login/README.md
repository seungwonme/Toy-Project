## Installation


### Setting up a Virtual Environment

Before installing the required packages, it's recommended to set up a virtual environment. This helps in managing dependencies specific to the project without affecting the global Python environment.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the application

```bash
python run.py
```
